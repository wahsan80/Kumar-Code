Data Structures: -
Way in which you can store your data efficiently[time and space complexities]

Types of Data Structures: -
1. Primitive DS (boolean, int, char, short, byte, float, long, double)
2. Non Primtive DS
  2.1 Linear DS
      String, Array, List, Set, Queue, ArrayList, LinkedList, HS, etc
  2.2 Non-Linear DS
       Graph, Trees
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Arrays can store both primitive and non-primitive(objects) type of data
   Collectio frameworks can only store non-primtive
2. Arrays can store homogeneous data
-----------------------------------------Collection Framework----------------------------
Collection Framework (API)
Collection - It is the single entity or object which can store multiple data
Framework - it represnts the library(it has pre-defined interfaces, abstract classes, classes, methods)

2 main parts
java.util.Collection
java.util.Map

Collection - it is an interface. It is the root interface present in java.util.package
Collections - It is a utility class. This contains only static methods


Please Study at least these: -

ArrayList
LinkedList
HashMap
Set
