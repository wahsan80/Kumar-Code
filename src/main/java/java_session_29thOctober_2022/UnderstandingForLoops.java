		//Step 2 : once the logic is executed inside the body then the updation expression will get activated
		//Step 3 : now i=2 after updation has happened. 
		//Step 4 : 2<=10 (true) -----> so like this the flow will go on
		//Step 5 : 10<=10 (true) and then i will get updated to 11
		//Step 11 : when i will become 11,  11<=10 (this condition is false)
