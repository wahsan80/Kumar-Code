	//What is a Constructor?
	//It is a block. It is similar to a method. But it is not a method. It has the name of the Class
	
	//Important Notes:-
	//1. Constructor does not have a return type
	//2. private, public, default, protected - can be used with Constructors
	//3. Constructors are invoked automatically when we create an Object
	
	//Uses of Constructor: -
	//1.  It is used to initialize an Object
	//2. It is used to optimize the code
	
	//Types of Constructors: -
	//1. Default Constructor (No argument) - Compiler generates this constructor automatically when the Object is created
	//2. No Argument(s)/Parameter(s) Constructor (user-defined)
	//2. Parameterized Constructor (user-defined)
	
	//Misconception - Constructor is used to create an Object (This is totally wrong
	//The ways to create an object are - new keyword, clone(), newInstance(), de-serialization, factory methods
	//Constructor is only used to initialize an object. Never to create one.
