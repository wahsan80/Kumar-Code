	//Poly means many

	//Types of Polymorphism: -
	//1. Compile Time Polymorphism/ Static Polymorphism
	//2. Run Time Polymorphism / Dynamic Polymorphism
	
	//Criterias to attain Compile (Static) Time Polymorphism
	//1. Achieved by Method Overloading
	//2. Method name should be same, Class should be same, Different Arguments/Parameters
	
	//Criterias to attain Run(Dynamic) Polymorphism
	//1. Achieved by Method overriding
	//2. Method name should be same, Class should be different, Same arguments/parameters
