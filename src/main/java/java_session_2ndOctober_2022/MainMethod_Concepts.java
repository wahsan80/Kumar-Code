	// methods are factories of a java class. they help in the logic production
	// you cannot change the name of the main method
	// you have to respect the nomenclature of main method
	// certain changes are allowed but within limits
	// main method is always static
	// main method can be overloaded ? - YES this you will understand when We will
	// learn OOP
	// main method is the center of execution of a java class
	// only and only main method has the ability to execute your code. No other
	// method has that ability
	// the position of access modifier and static keyword replacing each other does
	// not matter
	// String is a non-primitive data type
	// []represents an array
	// args is nothing but argument. This could be anything. It will work if you
	// give anything
	// (String[] args) will work, (String args[] will also work)
	// even (String... args) will also work
