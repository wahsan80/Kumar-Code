	//Arrays - advanced level programming
	//Data Structures and  Algorithms
	
	//Arrays: -
	
	//Array is the collection of homogeneous(Similar) data types
	//  [] - this is a dimension of an Array. This is 1-D
	//  [][] - this is 2-D array
	// [][][] - this is 3-D array
	// Arrays are divided into two types - One Dimensional Array and Multi-D Array (Matrix, Jagged)
	// Array's index position starts from 0
	//Array's takes up space in Heap Memory
	//Advantages:-
	 //1. Arrays can store multiple values
	//2. Faster compared to primitive data types because primitive data types use internal conversion of Wrapper Classes
	//3. They can store Objects as well
	
	//Disadvantes:-
	//1. I am fixing the size of the array. Cannot increase or decrease size of the array at runtime
	//2. Chances of memory wastage
	//3. Can only store data of similar origin
	
	//Arrays are created at runtime
	//Elements of arrays can be stored at consecutive memory locations
	
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		//There are 1000 students or employees in a company and want to store their stu_id, emp_id, student_name, emp_name
		
		int[] emp_id = new int[1000];
		
		String[] emp_name = new String[1000];
